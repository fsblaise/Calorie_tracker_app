# Calorie_tracker_app
A simple calorie tracker app, which helps you live a healthy life. 
It features authentication, logged in users can add new food to their own list and select items from that to create a daily intake. Each item in the list has a default quantity and a calorie value. 
The app checks the daily intake every 24 hours and sends a notification about the healthiness of that. This is also present in the my intake page.
